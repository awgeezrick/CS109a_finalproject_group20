    "\n",
    "1. **Content-Based**\n",
    "> Predicts based on what a user has listened to in the past.\n",
    "> Uses features of songs to find similar songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collarbotive**\n",
    "> Predicts based on what other listeners like\n",
    "> Focuses on what songs other users liked who also liked a chosen song. \n",

    "## Word2Vec\n",
    "In both types of recommender models, a 'vectorized' representation of a song is used to find similar songs.  For a given song, we find other songs that look similar.  With collarborative recommendations we need to take another step.  A song's vector value isn't deetrmined by the song properties, but rather its appearnace in playlists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both models, the selection approach is similar, we find others songs with similar vector values, but the vector values are calculated differently in each model.\n",
